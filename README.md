## Overview


TODO: Add a screenshot of the live project.

https://rspillane.github.io/forest-brewing-company/

A response single page website developed for a fictional brewery based in rural Warwickshire. Website is dynamically reponsive for both mobile and desktop, with the functionality of a simple shopping basket.

## Built With

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

## Learning Outcomes
I found I spent more time and effort, designing the aesthetics and trying to get good quality assets to use on the page. 
Making the website responsive to different screensizes, encourage me to read more into css @mediaqueries and css units such as fr.
If I were to do a similar project in the future, I follow the style of another website I like the look of more closely. To learn more about good design, whilst also focusing on the code side of things.
